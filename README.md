# Build a Survey Form

The [Build a Survey Form](https://feldbot.github.io/fcc-survey-form/) project is part of Free Code Camp's Responsive Web Design certificate curriculum. The [project requirements](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form/) are to create a responsive form that uses HTML5 validation and passes integrated tests.         

## Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JavaScript library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

## Installing

* Download or clone the repository and open the `index.html` file to view locally. Dependencies are linked to from `index.html`.
* If using Sass in your project, use `input.scss` as the source file. Sass will compile this into `main.css`.
